Network coding is a method of optimizing the stream of digital data in a good network by transmitting digital data about messages. The "digital data" is usually, itself, a composite of several messages. When the items of digital evidence arrive at the vacation spot, the transmitted message is deduced instead of directly reassembled.

The idea of network coding was first introduced by R. W. Yeung and Z. Zhang in 1999 as an alternative to routing. In a normal packet-switched network, info flows in identified, discrete "pieces" from the source to the destination like corpuscles in the bloodstream. At the transmitting station, the outgoing message is shattered into packets, each of which contains some of the message data intact. The packets usually do not actually all travelling along the same way but they all eventually reach the same vacation spot, where the getting computer reassembles them in to the original message. The main problem with this method is normally that when the overall network traffic volume is huge, bottlenecks are common, leading to long delays. Packets tend to bunch up at particular nodes, sometimes more than the nodes' capability to process them. Different routes and nodes may stay under-utilized.

In network coding, routers and switches are replaced by devices called coders. Rather than directing the packets toward their greatest destination like blood cells through something of arteries, the coders transmit metadata in the sort of digital evidence about the concept along multiple paths simultaneously. Conversely, the metadata arriving from several sources could be combined right into a one packet. This distribution technique can boost the effective potential of a network by reducing the quantity and severity of bottlenecks. The improvement is most pronounced when network site visitors volume is nearby the maximum ability obtainable with classic routing. Whenever a receiver has enough digital evidence, it can compute the intended concept/packet. Possibly if some packets on a number of the routes happen to be misplaced or mutilated, the initial concept gets through if the received digital data is sufficient.

In network coding, the info does not depend only on one transmitted message but also in the contents of different messages that happen to be sharing the route during transmission. That is why, network coding is more resistant to hacking, eavesdropping and additional types of attack than traditional data transmitting. The level of throughput improvement that network coding can provide is determined by the network topology and on the regularity and intensity of bottlenecks. In no function does network coding reduce the throughput weighed against the routing technique. Network coding may establish especially useful in multicast systems, wireless sensor networks, digital record distribution and peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing.
